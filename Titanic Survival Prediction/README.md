Titanic Survival Prediction Model:-

    This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The analysis is implemented in Python, leveraging essential data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Dataset:-  
    The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic voyage. It contains features like age, gender, ticket class, and whether the passenger survived or not.

Requirements:-
  Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
  Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
  Scikit-learn: Contains pre-implemented functions for data preprocessing, model development, and   evaluation.
  Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab: Useful for interactive development.

Usage:-

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git

Install the required Python libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('titanic_data.csv')

Explore the dataset:-
  Check its size:- df.shape (Output: 891 rows, 12 columns)
  Verify column data types: df.info()
  Descriptive statistics: df.describe()

Model Development:-

Data Preprocessing:-

Handle missing values (e.g., impute age based on median).
Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender).
Scale numerical features (e.g., using StandardScaler).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model:-

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
logreg_model = LogisticRegression()
logreg_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

Results:-
  The trained model can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster with reasonable accuracy. Feel free to contribute, improve, or adapt this model for your specific use case!

Remember to replace placeholders (such as X_train, y_train, and dataset file paths) with your actual data and code. Best of luck with your Titanic Survival Prediction project!
