The primary goal of this project is to create predictive models for sales in Big Mart outlets. By understanding the factors influencing sales, we can optimize inventory levels, improve revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Dataset:-
  We utilize a dataset containing information about various products sold in Big Mart outlets. The dataset includes features such as product weight, visibility, type, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is available in the file Train.csv.

Data Preprocessing:-
  In the data preprocessing phase, we handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Additionally, we explore correlations and perform feature engineering to improve model performance.

Model Training:-
  Our chosen model is the XGBoost Regressor, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its robustness and efficiency. We train the model on the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters and ensuring robustness against overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics:-
  To assess our model’s performance, we use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the model’s ability to predict sales effectively.

Results and Insights:-
  Our trained XGBoost Regressor model demonstrates promising results in estimating sales for Big Mart products. By leveraging these insights, we can make informed decisions regarding inventory management and pricing strategies.
