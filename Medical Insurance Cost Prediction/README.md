  Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust model that accurately predicts medical insurance costs based on patient attributes. By understanding the factors influencing insurance expenses, we can assist healthcare providers, insurers, and individuals in making informed decisions.

Dataset:-
  We utilize a dataset containing information about patients, including features such as age, gender, BMI, smoker status, and region. The dataset is available in the file insurance.csv.

Data Preprocessing:-
  In the data preprocessing phase, we handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Additionally, we explore correlations and perform feature selection to improve model performance.

Model Training:-
  Our chosen model is Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm. We train the model on the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters and ensuring robustness against overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics:-
  To assess our model’s performance, we use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model’s ability to predict insurance costs effectively.

Results and Insights:-
  Our trained Logistic Regression model demonstrates promising results in estimating medical insurance costs. By understanding the impact of various factors, we can empower stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding healthcare coverage.
