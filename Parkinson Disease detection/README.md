Parkinson’s Disease Detection Model:-

  This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting Parkinson’s disease using Python. The model is trained on data collected from a hospital and utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

Dataset:-
  The dataset used for this project includes 755 columns and three observations for each patient. These columns capture various diagnostic features that differentiate between healthy individuals and those affected by Parkinson’s disease.

Requirements:-
  Make sure you have the following libraries installed:-

  Pandas: For handling data frames and analysis tasks.
  Numpy: Fast array computations.
  Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
  Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Contains pre-implemented functions for data preprocessing, model development, and       evaluation.
  XGBoost: Utilized for achieving high prediction accuracy.
  Imblearn: Useful for handling data imbalance.
  
Usage:-
  Clone this repository to your local machine.
  Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
  Load the dataset into a Pandas data frame.
  
Explore the dataset:-
Check its size: df.shape (Output: 756 rows, 755 columns)
Verify column data types: df.info()
Descriptive statistics: df.describe()

Model Development:-
Data Preprocessing:-
  Handle any missing values (fortunately, there are no null values in this dataset).
  Encode categorical features if necessary.
  Scale numerical features (e.g., using MinMaxScaler).
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  Feature selection (e.g., using SelectKBest and chi-squared test).
  Train an SVM model.
  Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Results:-
  The trained model can predict whether a person suffers from Parkinson’s disease or not with high accuracy.
